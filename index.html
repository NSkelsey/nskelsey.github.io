      <h3 class=bhead>Understanding Bits of Debian</h3>
      <div class = story!>
        <p>
        As a final project for my operating systems course I tried to get a Debian package updated in the official package archive. The package was a bundling of the apache projects full-text search engine solr. I ended up failing miserably at this stated goal, but I learned a couple things in process and want to make it easier for someone to understand what I now know to be a simple, but time-consuming process. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Before I go any further let me give a disclaimer about the knowledge distributed below. I do not claim to know
        all of the details of package management nor am I 100% positive that my interpretation of what I have read and
        done is correct. However, I approached the problem as any new wannabe Debian developer did and started by
        reading the many things I was told to. After packaging and altering some minor self made packages it appeared to
        me that I had the chops to take on updating the solr distribution.I found out that I did not.
        </p>
        <p>
        As it turns out, how I couldn't get the package updated is not an interesting story. So instead I will talk
        about what I learned about package management and some perspective gained from the experience. Before I explain
        how Debian works, I would like to explain how software is generally distributed. This is mainly to see if I can
        get my roommate to read past the fifth paragraph. So skip this next section if you happen to be a computer
        science proffesor.
        </p>
        <h3>A Gentle Introduction to Distributing Software</h3>
        <p>
        Consider the web-browser you are using to visit this website right now. You are probably using a browser that
        has been constantly updated or needed updating since you first started using it. This means that people are
        actively improving the code that is used to 'build' your web-browser. Many other programs on your computer also
        require updates including your operating system itself. When the developers of some application make changes to code which
        requires an update, we say they are releasing those changes.
        </p>
        <p>
        Software can be released in a huge number of ways, but generally there are two approaches. Either the software
        running on a user's computer can detect when homebase (the upstream source) has an update for it or periodically
        the user can check or be asked to check whether software running on their system needs updating. In addition to
        this, the update to the codebase is sometimes big enough to warrant a whole new version of the software, which requires a fresh installation of the new release.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now most essential software running on your machine, if it is a Mac or PC will either update itself or ask for
        your permission to update, but things are different for operating systems that are free. Most popular Linux
        based operating systems including Debian have things called package management systems associated with them.
        From the users point of view these systems are the source of all system updates and the central repositories of
        almost every useful tool and piece of  software out there. The big picture about package management is that it
        is the way software is distributed, released and installed for most free operating systems. Meaning the
        packagement system is crucial to the security, stability and sucess of the operating system.
        </p>
        <h3> Package Management in Debian</h3>
        <p>
        Now onto some gross specifics, package management in Debian comes down to one simple task --editing the contents
        of and then building a .deb file. A .deb file is a compressed archive file that contains everything the
        operating system needs to install that file. Put simply, installing a .deb file is how a user gets new software onto their system. These archive files contain a number of things shown in the picture below.
        </p>
        <img src=./deb-file.gif alt="building .deb files"> </img>
        <p>
        We can see that the .deb file contains two main things. The source code of the software, various licenses, a
        makefile and a set of Debian specific configuration files. Tools included with Debian when you first install it understand this
        configuration and will do the "right thing" during installation.
        </p>
        <div class=aside>
          If you want to examine the contents of some package you found on the internet use:<br>
        <code >
          dpkg -x packagename.deb ./
        </code>
      </div>

        <p>
        The configuration specified in the debian directory can do any number of things. These files follow a documented
        set of conventions, which you need to follow if the package is going into the archive. Here's an <a
          href=http://www.Debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/best-pkging-practices.html#bpp-Debian-changelog >
          example</a>.... Despite there being a "right way" to do things the configuration files for packages
        essentially have free reign on a system once they are invoked. Since installation almost always requires
        super-user privileges these packages can do anything. See <a href=http://gnome-look.org/groups/?id=458>here</a> for an example of when someone abuses this.
        </p>
        <p>
        For projects larger than our catsay example, the .deb file contains only the software's binary and system
        configuration. We must have some method to generate this file from the source code of the application we want to  package. If
        the build process of that application is poorly implemented this becomes hard.</p>
        <p> Conceptually the generation of the .deb file is pretty simple. All that is required is the original source
        code of the software and the build tools that compile that code into an executable binary. Note that for our
        smaller cowsay project we could just compile everything at install time. With larger projects this would take
        hours.</p>
        <p> The source code files plus that same debian directory are combined in another archive file with the extension .dsc. The debian source file, is
        then used to build the .deb file using more configuration specified in, you guessed it, the debian directory!
        This actually took me an embarrassingly long time to understand, and I think a picture does a good job of
        describing it. So here: </p>
        <img src=./building-from-source.gif alt="debian build process"> </img> 
        <p>
        So, say we found some software we want to package, perhaps a full text search 
        <a  href=http://lucene.apache.org/solr/ >engine</a>.
         We have a .dsc file that builds our .deb file and when we install the
        .deb file everything works and the program is installed on our system. We are done right? Wrong. Our package
        still needs to get into the centralized repository before anyone other than your closest bestest friends use it.
        These package archives are carefully maintained by members of the Debian project. Since any
        package listed could potentially compromise your system, there is a highish quality standard for software that
        is listed.  Packages in the archive are logically separated by purpose, which is documented
        <a href=http://www.Debian.org/doc/Debian-policy/ch-archive.html>here</a>.
        </p>
        <img src=package-archive.gif alt="debian package archives"> </img>

        <p>
        Since our new package is high quality and interesting, we must identity where this package should live in the archive
        and find somebody to put it there. To do this you need someone who is officially a member of the Debian project to
        "sponsor" your upload. This means that there is a process for finding a sponsor as well. Again this is not particularly interesting so here it is described in pictures.
        </p>

        <img src=./update-process.jpg alt="update process"> </img>

        <p>
        Once our deb file is uploaded to the archive it will be available for download by anyone! Huzzah! If people use
        the software some of them might find bugs, which we are now responsible for patching. At this point, we are
        committed to distributing our software through Debian's system. But, we are one step closer to gaining upload privleges.
        </p>
        <p>
        The takeaway from getting your package sponsored is that, the burden of getting everything working is on you. A
        member only has to replicate your claims of functionality, which is quite easy to do and then upload your
        changes following a set <a
          href=http://www.Debian.org/doc/manuals/developers-reference/beyond-pkging.html#sponsoring>policy</a>. This is actually is a great way to run a distributed project and means that for those on the outside must really be motivated to contribute. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          Package Maintence is the lion's share of work for the Debian project.
        </h3>
        <p>
        To become a member of the Debian project, or a "Debian Developer" is to gain two crucial privileges, upload
        rights into every package archive and a vote in procedural matters. There are by my estimates around 670
        active Debian Developers (<a
          href=http://people.Debian.org/~spaillard/developers-age-histogramm/devs-age-histo.2013-12-01.png >source</a>) and each one of them has a PGP key that lets them update any package in the archive 
        </p>
        <p>
        Since every package in the archive is also an open-source project, the maintainers of Debian are only required
        to update those packages to see real improvements in their operating system. There over 40,000 packages
        maintained in the archive, meaning requests to update packages come all the time.
        This works great for updating software that the packaga management system can distribute. But,to update package
        management system itself is to change how <em>every</em> piece of software interacts with Debian.
        </p>
        <p>
        Since Debian one of the oldest distrobutions, change is incremental. This explains the huge number of small tools that a
        contributor must know how to use before they can contribute. The learning curve alone partly explains why new distributions of
        linux keep popping up. Many of them, like Arch-Linux have essentially iterated on the Debian's package management
        system by making it easier for new users to contribute into the system.</p> 
        <p>This makes sense, no sane person would spend time
        trying to get the Debian community to change their system. It would be easier to just go make a better one. The only way to meaningfully
        improve such a core and fundamental system is to create a new version of it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Which is what happens all the <a href=http://futurist.se/gldt/wp-content/uploads/12.10/gldt1210.svg >time.</a>
